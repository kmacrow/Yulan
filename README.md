Yulan
=====

A JavaScript UI Toolkit (to replace the rest)

Yulan aims to provide an extremely polished set of UI components for JavaScript application developers. 
None of the most popular frameworks (Dojo, jQuery UI, MooTools, Qooxdoo, ExtJS, etc.) offer a level of sophistication 
comparable to the world's most advanced desktop environments. Enter Yulan.
