# Yulan [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kmacrow/Yulan.png)](https://travis-ci.org/kmacrow/Yulan)

A JavaScript UI System (to replace the rest)

Yulan aims to provide a beautiful, high performance GUI toolkit for browser-based HTML5 applications. 
None of the most popular open source frameworks (Dojo, jQuery UI, MooTools, Qooxdoo, ExtJS, etc.) offer a level of sophistication 
comparable to the most advanced desktop operating systems. The Yulan kernel is a small, fast, extremely powerful UI
system for building rich, desktop-quality apps.
 
# Getting Started

Yulan is built with the LESS CSS preprocessor and powered by the Sizzle.js selector engine. To build
Yulan you'll need to install the LESS compiler, JSHint, uglify-js and recess. The project is in
pre-alpha development right now (Feb 2013), alpha is expected to land in May. 

Get the code:
```
git clone git://github.com/kmacrow/Yulan.git
```

Install tools:
```
$ npm install -g less jshint recess uglify-js
```

Build Yulan:
```
$ make
```
