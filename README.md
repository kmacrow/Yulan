Yulan
=====

A JavaScript UI Toolkit (to replace the rest)

Yulan aims to provide an extremely polished UI system for JavaScript application developers. 
None of the most popular frameworks (Dojo, jQuery UI, MooTools, Qooxdoo, ExtJS, etc.) offer a level of sophistication 
comparable to the world's most advanced desktop operating systems. The Yulan kernel is a small, fast, extremely powerful windowing
system for building desktop-quality applications in HTML5 browsers.
