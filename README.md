Yulan
=====

A JavaScript UI System (to replace the rest)

Yulan aims to provide a beautiful, high performance GUI toolkit for browser-based applications. 
None of the most popular frameworks (Dojo, jQuery UI, MooTools, Qooxdoo, ExtJS, etc.) offer a level of sophistication 
comparable to the world's most advanced desktop operating systems. The Yulan kernel is a small, fast, extremely powerful UI
system for building rich applications in HTML5 browsers.
